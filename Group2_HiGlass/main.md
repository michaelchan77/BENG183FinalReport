## 1. Introduction<a name="1"></a>

The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in the number of publicly available chromosome conformation capture (3C) datasets (Hi-C, HiChIP, etc.) released, in addition to corresponding 1D genomic datasets (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.) produced due to efforts spearheaded by large consortiums like the 4D Nucleome Network and the ENCODE Project, alongside those of individual labs []. This explosion in data output has prompted the need for sophisticated, seamless, and accessible data visualization tools in order to enable researchers to efficiently and effectively compare functional genomics and epigenomics datasets across multiple cell types, treatments, and conditions.<br>

HiGlass, developed in 2018 by the [HIDIVE Lab](https://hidivelab.org/) at Harvard Medical School, aims to address this need. HiGlass is an open source visualization tool for exploring large genomic datasets such as Hi-C contact matrices, enabling the visual interrogration of chromatin organization at multiple scales including compartments, TADs, and loops, among others, alongisde information from other high-throughput assays examining, for example, chromatin accessibility or transcription factor binding patterns.<br>

## 2. Overview<a name="2"></a>

#### Why HiGlass?<a name="21"></a>

The growing complexity and scale of genomic datasets in recent years have led to a surge in advanced visualization tools. Libraries like D3.js and tools such as Vega and Juicebox have been widely adopted, providing researchers with accessible and effective ways to create static and interactive visualizations. However, as datasets have grown to unprecedented sizes, these methods can struggle with performance at scale due to the need to load the entire dataset into memory [7].

The challenge is particularly evident with the advent of Hi-C contact matrices, which map spatial interactions within the genome. These matrices can contain billions of data points at multiple resolutions, pushing traditional tools beyond their limits [4].

> Further reading on Hi-C contact matrices and the assay itself is provided in the **Hi-C Background** section.

HiGlass is explicitly designed to tackle these issues. Inspired by online map tools like Google Maps, HiGlass seamlessly integrates zooming, panning, and synchronized views to allow the exploration of genomic data at multiple scales without sacrificing performance or responsiveness [2]. 

#### How It Works<a name="22"></a>
HiGlass relies on sophisticated downsampling and splicing techniques to efficiently handle large-scale datasets [7]. These methods reduce the dataset's resolution for broad-scale views while preserving high-resolution details for focused exploration.

To dynamically load and render data in manageable chunks, HiGlass uses a tiling approach much like online maps load tiles of geographical data. Additionally, it leverages generic functions to enable flexible integration of custom data types and visualization modules, extending its utility beyond Hi-C matrices to other genomic and multi-dimensional data types.

> More details about these techniques can be found in the HiGlass team's blog posts.

#### Hi-C Background<a name="23"></a>

Hi-C is a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay developed initially in 2009. An *in situ* Hi-C protocol was introduced in 2014. In brief, Hi-C is performed as follows: cells are first cross-linked with formaldehyde, resulting in covalent links between segments of chromatin that are proximal in 3D space. DNA is then digested with a restriction enzyme. The 5â€™ ends are filled with nucleotides, one of which is biotinylated. The resulting fragments are ligated. Then, a Hi-C library is created by shearing the DNA and selecting fragments with biotin tags using streptavidin beads. The library is finally sequenced using paired-end sequencing.<br> 

![](hic_protocol.png)

Hi-C can report chromatin interactions between all loci pairwise (all-by-all). These include both interchromosomal and intrachromosomal interactions and may be structural (define TAD boundaries and often marked by CTCF) or regulatory (connect cis-regulatory elements to their target genes).<br>

Interactions are typically represented as a contact matrix, with one axis as the genome, the other as the same genome, and each cell containing the number of times those two portions of the genome were caught in close proximity. The genome is binned in sizes ranging from 5kb to 50kb and the contact frequency between any two bins is represented on a color scale. Points of focal enrichment represent chromatin loops, as shown below:<br>

## 3. Tracks and Views<a name="3"></a>
HiGlass offers extensive view and track customization to facilitate Hi-C data visualization. Researchers will select the viewing experience which best suits their experimental conditions and data attributes. 

### Views
Dynamic viewing capabilities allow researchers to easily compare differences between different conditions or examine changes within samples. For example, a researcher may desire to zoom into select regions of the contact matrix and make comparisons. This is feasible through customizing a view which maintains the current state of the heatmap, but also displays the zoomed regions in separate matrices. This is in contrast with other methods which would require zooming in the same matrix window and screenshotting to make comparisons. An example is shown below with three zoomed in windows showing telomere clustering, while one window provides the original view.

</p>
Additionally, users may desire to view the same region across multiple conditions simultaneously. Linked views facilitate this by allowing the user to load in multiple datasets and create side-by-side views. As the views are linked, actions performed in one window such as moving to explore the contact map will cause the same movement in the other windows. Below, we explore the difference in structures between six different cancer cell lines.

### Tracks

## 4. Preparing Data for HiGlass<a name="4"></a>
Preparing data from Hi-C experiments or annotations from ChiP-seq and RNA-seq experiments for import into HiGlass is a straightforward process. This guide outlines the essential tools and steps required to format and import your data into HiGlass successfully. 

### 2D Tracks<a name="41"></a>
For visualization of chromatin contact structures from Hi-C sequencing data.

#### Tools required: <br>
Python (3.x) <br>
HiC-Pro <br>
Bowtie2 or BWA <br>
Cooler (Python library) <br>
Samtools (Optional) <br>

#### Steps:

1. Map reads in sequencing data to reference genome using Bowtie2 or BWA, here we will use Bowtie

`bowtie2 -x <reference_index> -1 <read1.fq> -2 <read2.fq> -S <output.sam> --very-sensitive -p <threads>`

- To run Bowtie, the reference genome needs to be indexed

  `bowtie2-build reference.fasta genome_index`

2. (Optional) Convert .sam file output into .bam file for downstream steps using Samtools

`samtools view -S -b input.sam > output.bam`

3. Convert reads into mapped pairs using HiC-Pro to generate contact matrix

`hic-pro -i <input_dir> -o <output_dir> -c <config_file>`

- HiC-Pro config file contains specific parameters such as genome size, restriction enzyme cut sites, and paths to required tools. Click here for more information: https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro/blob/master/config-hicpro.txt 

4. Use contact matrix output from HiC-Pro to make .cool files for HiGlass import by running Cooler

`cooler cload --field count bins.bed matrix.txt output.cool`

- bins.bed: BED file defining genomic bins from HiC-Pro<br>
- matrix.txt: matrix file from HiC-Pro<br>
- output.cool: name of the .cool file<br>

5. Import into HiGlass

## 5. HiGlass in Action: Case Study<a name="5"></a>

To explore the capabilities of HiGlass, we will examine a case study based off of the [Schwarzer, W., et al., 2017 Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24281). In this paper, they studied the effect of depleting NIBPL, a cohesin co-factor essential to chromatin loop formation through loop extrusion, on 3D genome architecture in adult mouse hepatocytes.<br>

First, begin by navigating to the HiGlass web app homepage:<br>

![](higlass_homepage.png)

We will load two 2D tracks, one for wildtype (WT) and one for NIBPL knockdown. To do so, select "Add Track", the center panel, and choose our files of interest (add link to download here):<br>

![](higlass_add_tracks.png)

This is what the HiGlass visualization should look like after both tracks have been added (WT on the left and NIBPL knockdown on the right):<br>

![](higlass_with_tracks.png)

One of the novel features of HiGlass is its ability to create linked views, where zooming in or out or dragging a track in one view automatically scales or shifts the other views in sync. We can link the two views by selecting the settings icon in one of the views, clicking "Lock zoom and location with", and then choosing the other view:<br>

![](higlass_add_linked_view.png)

We can also add additional 1D tracks. Let's add a ChIP-seq signal track to each view. To do so, select the plus icon to add a new track, choose the top panel, and select the correct track file from the list:<br>

![](higlass_add_1D_tracks.png)

This is what the views look like once the 1D tracks have been added (see the green signal track above each contact map):<br>

![](higlass_with_1D.png)

Just like Google Maps, we can now zoom in on particular regions of interest on our contact maps. As an example, let's inspect the 20mb region on chr14. Enter the coordinates shown below into one of the search bars (we can do this for either view, as they are linked). Then select the search icon and zoom in to this region: <br>

![](higlass_zoomed_in.png)

Note the differences between the WT and NIBPL knockdown contact matrices: in the NIBPL knockdown, there is a clear loss of loops and TAD structures along the downward diagonal. From this region, we can infer that loop extrusion may not be able to occur as effectively in the absence of the NIBPL cohension loading factor.<br>
